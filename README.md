# SHLLConvection
2D Convection simulation with compressible Euler equations

## Problem

The code is set up to simulate a square box with a heated wall. All conditions are normalized. Gravity is hard coded into the Y direction in this code and arbitrarily normalized and set; you can experiment with the amount of gravity by changing the variable G.

The results expected after 10k steps are shown in the pictures included with the source code.
